A simple app which checks a feed reader and then sends info to teh publisher abotu stories read, stared, commented... etc.
May support Webmentions if this makes sense.

Also, it sends info which can be *verified* like sign things with a public key? using the From: header?

At first, just load read stories and starred stories.
